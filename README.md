This project is a Java-based Flappy Bird clone developed using Swing and AWT for handling graphics. In this game, you control a bird that must navigate through pipes by flapping.
Your goal is to fly as far as possible without hitting any pipes or falling to the ground.

Key Features:
→ Custom Graphics: Includes a background, bird, pipes, and other visual elements created specifically for the game.
→ Smooth Physics: The bird moves realistically with gravity and can be controlled using the spacebar.
→ Random Pipe Generation: Pipes appear at random heights, offering a unique challenge each time you play.
→ Score Tracking: Your score increases each time you pass a set of pipes and is displayed during the game.
→ Game Over Screen: The game ends when the bird crashes into a pipe or hits the ground, with your score shown on the screen.

Requirements:
→ Java 8 or higher
→ Image files: bg.png, fbimg.png, top.png, bot.png

How to Play:
Press the spacebar to make the bird flap and steer it through the pipes. Your objective is to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score!
